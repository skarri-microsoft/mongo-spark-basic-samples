# Cosmos DB Mongo Spark Basic Samples

It has 3 files:

1. Databricks scala notebook which contains two scenarios:
      a. Simple insert of dummy docs
      b. Reading json file and insert into Cosmos DB Mongo

2. Uber jar built locally for testing purpose.

3. Sample data.

Note: To try these scenarios on sharded collections, you need to add 'test' shard key in first collection and "id" shard key in second collection.
